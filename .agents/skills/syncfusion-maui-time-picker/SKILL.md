# Implementing Syncfusion .NET MAUI TimePicker

The Syncfusion .NET MAUI TimePicker (SfTimePicker) is a powerful control that allows users to select time values through an intuitive scrollable interface. It supports multiple time formats, customizable intervals, dialog modes, time restrictions, and extensive styling options.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Implement time selection in .NET MAUI applications
- Add SfTimePicker controls to XAML or C# code
- Configure time formats (12/24 hour, with/without seconds, milliseconds)
- Set up dialog or positioned picker modes
- Define hour/minute/second intervals for time selection
- Restrict selectable times (business hours, appointment slots, blocked times)
- Handle time selection events or use MVVM commands
- Customize picker appearance (header, footer, selection view, text display)
- Implement accessible or localized time pickers
- Troubleshoot TimePicker configuration or behavior issues

## Component Overview

The SfTimePicker provides:
- **14 predefined time formats** supporting 12/24-hour formats with hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds
- **Three picker modes**: Default (inline), Dialog (popup), and RelativeDialog (positioned popup)
- **Time intervals** for hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds
- **Time restrictions** including minimum/maximum time and blackout times
- **Looping support** for seamless navigation between first and last items
- **Rich event system** with selection changes, dialog lifecycle, and footer button events
- **MVVM support** through commands (SelectionChangedCommand, AcceptCommand, DeclineCommand)
- **Extensive customization** for header, footer, column headers, selection view, and text display modes
- **Accessibility** and localization support for global applications

## Documentation and Navigation Guide

### Getting Started
📄 **Read:** [references/getting-started.md](references/getting-started.md)

**When to read:** Setting up TimePicker for the first time, installation, basic implementation.

**Coverage:**
- NuGet package installation (Syncfusion.Maui.Picker)
- Handler registration (ConfigureSyncfusionCore in MauiProgram.cs)
- Basic SfTimePicker initialization (XAML and C#)
- Setting header and footer views
- Configuring height and width
- Using SelectedTime property
- Clear selection support

### Time Formatting
📄 **Read:** [references/formatting.md](references/formatting.md)

**When to read:** Configuring how time is displayed (12/24 hour, including/excluding seconds, milliseconds).

**Coverage:**
- Format property overview
- 14 predefined time formats:
  - `H_mm`, `H_mm_ss` (24-hour without leading zero)
  - `HH_mm`, `HH_mm_ss`, `HH_mm_ss_fff` (24-hour with leading zero)
  - `h_mm_tt`, `h_mm_ss_tt` (12-hour without leading zero + AM/PM)
  - `hh_mm_tt`, `hh_mm_ss_tt`, `hh_mm_ss_fff_tt`, `hh_tt` (12-hour with leading zero + AM/PM)
  - `mm_ss`, `mm_ss_fff`, `ss_fff` (minute/second combinations)
  - `Default` (culture-based format)
- Format usage examples and switching between formats

### Picker Modes and Display
📄 **Read:** [references/picker-modes.md](references/picker-modes.md)

**When to read:** Configuring how the picker is displayed (inline, popup dialog, positioned dialog).

**Coverage:**
- Mode property (Default, Dialog, RelativeDialog)
- Dialog mode configuration
- IsOpen property for programmatic picker control
- RelativeDialog mode for positioned popups
- RelativePosition options (8 alignment positions):
  - AlignTop, AlignBottom, AlignToLeftOf, AlignToRightOf
  - AlignTopLeft, AlignTopRight, AlignBottomLeft, AlignBottomRight
- RelativeView property for positioning relative to specific controls
- Custom popup size (PopupWidth, PopupHeight properties)
- Code examples for each mode

### Time Intervals and Looping
📄 **Read:** [references/time-intervals-looping.md](references/time-intervals-looping.md)

**When to read:** Setting intervals between time values or enabling continuous looping.

**Coverage:**
- HourInterval property (e.g., show every 2 hours)
- MinuteInterval property (e.g., show every 5, 10, 15 minutes)
- SecondInterval property (e.g., show every 10 seconds)
- MilliSecondInterval property for precise time selection
- EnableLooping property for seamless first ↔ last item navigation
- Combining intervals with different time formats
- Practical scenarios (appointment booking, time tracking)

### Time Restrictions
📄 **Read:** [references/time-restrictions.md](references/time-restrictions.md)

**When to read:** Limiting selectable times (business hours, min/max ranges, blocked times).

**Coverage:**
- MinimumTime property to set earliest selectable time
- MaximumTime property to set latest selectable time
- BlackoutTimes collection to disable specific times
- Time range validation rules
- Use cases (business hours: 9 AM - 5 PM, appointment slots, blocked lunch hours)
- Combining restrictions with formats and intervals

### Events and Commands
