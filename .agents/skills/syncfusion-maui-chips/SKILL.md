# Implementing .NET MAUI Chips

The Syncfusion .NET MAUI Chips control provides versatile and feature-rich components (`SfChip` and `SfChipGroup`) for displaying information in compact, interactive layouts. Chips enable users to view, select, filter, or trigger actions through visually appealing and customizable UI elements.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user needs to:

- **Display categorical data** as compact, interactive chips (tags, labels, categories)
- **Implement selection interfaces** with single or multi-select chip groups
- **Create input chips** that can be dynamically added or removed by users
- **Build filter interfaces** with multi-selection indicators for data filtering
- **Add action chips** that execute commands when clicked
- **Customize chip appearance** with colors, borders, icons, fonts, and images
- **Handle chip interactions** through selection events, click handlers, or removal events
- **Bind chip data** from collections using ItemsSource and DisplayMemberPath

## Component Overview

**SfChip:** Individual chip component with text, icon, close button, and customization options.

**SfChipGroup:** Container that manages multiple chips with support for:
- Four chip types: Input, Choice, Filter, Action
- Data binding with ItemsSource
- Selection modes and visual states
- Layout customization (FlexLayout, StackLayout, etc.)
- Event handling for selection and removal

**Key Capabilities:**
- Dynamic chip creation and removal
- Single and multi-selection modes
- Visual selection indicators
- Icon and background image support
- Comprehensive styling options
- MVVM command support
- Event-driven interactions

## Documentation and Navigation Guide

### Getting Started
📄 **Read:** [references/getting-started.md](references/getting-started.md)

When the user needs to:
- Install and configure Syncfusion .NET MAUI Chips package
- Register the Syncfusion Core handler in MauiProgram.cs
- Create first SfChip or SfChipGroup
- Set up chip layouts (FlexLayout, StackLayout)
- Understand basic chip setup and configuration
- See a minimal working example

### Chip Types and Selection Modes
📄 **Read:** [references/chip-types.md](references/chip-types.md)

When the user needs to:
- Understand the four chip types: Input, Choice, Filter, Action
- Implement Input chips with dynamic add/remove functionality
- Create Choice chips with single selection (ChoiceMode: Single, SingleOrNone)
- Build Filter chips with multi-selection and selection indicators
- Use Action chips with command execution
- Configure visual states for selected/normal states
- Choose the appropriate chip type for their use case

### Customization and Styling
📄 **Read:** [references/customization.md](references/customization.md)

When the user needs to:
- Customize individual SfChip appearance
  - Show/hide close button and selection indicator
  - Change colors (background, text, border, close button, selection indicator)
  - Modify border properties (stroke thickness, corner radius)
  - Style text (font size, family, attributes, color, alignment)
  - Configure icons (show, source, size, alignment)
  - Add background images
- Customize SfChipGroup styling
  - Set chip and selected chip colors
  - Configure border and padding
  - Adjust item height and text size
  - Style selection indicators
- Implement commands for MVVM pattern
- Apply consistent theming across chip groups

### Populating Data
📄 **Read:** [references/populating-data.md](references/populating-data.md)

When the user needs to:
- Bind business objects to chips using ItemsSource
- Use DisplayMemberPath to specify the text property
- Use ImageMemberPath to bind icon images
- Create model and ViewModel classes for chip data
- Populate chips with SfChip items directly using Items collection
- Add InputView for dynamic chip creation
- Implement data binding best practices
- Handle AOT publishing considerations with [Preserve] attribute

### Events and Interactions
📄 **Read:** [references/events.md](references/events.md)

When the user needs to:
- Handle SelectionChanging event (cancellable, before selection)
- Handle SelectionChanged event (after selection completes)
- Respond to ChipClicked events
- Handle ItemRemoved events for Input type chips
- Capture CloseButtonClicked events
- Understand event arguments and properties
- Know which events are supported for each chip type

### Advanced Features
📄 **Read:** [references/advanced-features.md](references/advanced-features.md)

When the user needs to:
- Apply font icons to chips (custom icon fonts)
- Use DataTemplateSelector for custom chip templates
- Implement Liquid Glass visual effects
- Programmatically control selection with IsSelected property
- Handle AOT publishing requirements
- Apply platform-specific customizations
